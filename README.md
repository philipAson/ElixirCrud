**TODO: Add description**

# Users

<!-- We are going to create a simple `User` module which has a number of stored users and then we will add functionality to list, find and filter the users. -->

### Step 1:

<!-- Store 10 random users in a module attribute.
Each user should have: id, name, email


 age, created_at (time), and deleted (boolean). -->

### Step 2

<!-- 

Add functionality to:

- List all users 
- Find a user by id 
- Find a user by email 

-->

### Step 3:

<!-- 

- Allow limiting the number of users returned     [X]
- Enable filtering of users by age                [X]
- Enable filtering of users by deleted status     [X]
- Allow sorting of users by age                   [X]
- Allow sorting of users by created_at            [X]
- Allow sorting of users by name                  [X]
-->

### Step 4:     

<!-- - Add a search functionality that enables searching for a user by email. It should be possible to search using only a part of the email. -->
